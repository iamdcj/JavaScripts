# Paradigms in JavaScript

### What is a Paradigm?

Paradigms in programming are a particular style/way of programming.

A programming language can lend itself to a particular paradigm, i.e. a language might be best written using a a particular paradigm, e.g.

> Haskell is a functional programming language.

The above line simply means that the language is intended to be written in a functional manner, because the language's feature set is catered towards that particular paradigm.
It doesn't mean that a program in that language can't be written using a different paradigm, _but_ using a different paradigm might not be the best way to write code in that language.

### Multi-Paradigm Languages

In essense all languages can be written using different paradigms, but as above some languages are best written using a specific paradigm, other languages are flexible; they are well-suited to more than one particular paradigm.

**JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language** - you can 'easily' engineer applications using the one of the following paradigms:

- [Onject-Oriented](object-oriented-programming)
- [Functional](functional)
- Event-Driven
