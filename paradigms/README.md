# Paradigms in JavaScript

## What is a Paradigm?

Paradigms in programming are a particular style/way of programming.

A programming language can lend itself to a particular paradigm, i.e. a language might be best written using a a particular paradigm, e.g.

> Haskell is a functional programming language.

The above line simply means that the language is intended to be written in a functional manner, because the language's feature set is catered towards that particular paradigm.
It doesn't mean that a program in that language can't be written using a different paradigm, _but_ using a different paradigm might not be the best way to write code in that language.

### Paradigm Categories

The following are two main approaches to writing programs;

#### Imperative Programming

Imperative programing is concerned with control flow, and _how_ a thing is achieved in the code.

Imperative programming documents the entire control flow of a function,
the how is clear due to the usage of statements in the function; if, else, for, while;
The control flow is explicitly documented in the code; each step of the function is visible.

There is no abstraction, the program contains all the statements and control flow required to get to the final result.

#### Declarative Programming

Declarative programming concerns itself with the end result, essentially _what_ is to be achieved in the code. There is some imperative abstraction layer in operation, the end goal is achieved, but the statements and control flow is dealt with in said abstraction.

**The code describes what it's intention, without documenting each instruction.**

## Multi-Paradigm Languages

In essense all languages can be written using different paradigms, but as above some languages are best written using a specific paradigm, other languages are flexible; they are well-suited to more than one particular paradigm.

**JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language**, and JS programs are often written using one of the following paradigms:

- [Onject-Oriented](object-oriented-programming) (Imperative)
- [Functional](functional) (Declarative)
