# Functional Programming

FP is a declarative approach to writing software; the functions we create are not concerned with control flow; the how is abstracted from the code. The focus of declarative code is the what; _the data flow of the application/function_.

Due to its declarative nature the code is concise, easier to follow, easier to debug and easier to test.

It is also predictable; pure functions are the key to functional programming, and pure functions are predictable, thus the program becomes more predictable when FP is implemented.

## Core Concepts

The following are the core concepts of functional programming;

- [Pure Functions](pure-functions)
- [Avoid Shared State](shared-state)
- [Avoid State Mutations](state-mutations)
- [Avoid Side Effects](side-effects)
