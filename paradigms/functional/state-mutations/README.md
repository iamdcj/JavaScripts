# Avoid State Mutations

We mutate when our functions work with composite data types directly; if we do not create a new copy of the composite data, we reference it directly; _composites are passed by reference_, thus working on the reference will update the original.

By avoiding state mutations, we will get consistent and predictable results in our functions; the same input will yield the same output because we donâ€™t change the original data, we use a true copy of it instead.

**If we modify state, we no longer have predictable data to work with, and our functions are no longer pure.**

Ideally the objects and arrays we create would be immutable upon generation, however without a library to help us, the best we can do is ensure we do not modify the original objects/arrays in our functions.

### Examples

This example uses the state to generate values in an immutable fashion; the originals are never modified.

#### State

```
const user = {
  age: 31
}
```

#### Functions

These functions use the user object to perform a calculation, how the return values have no impact on the original state.

```
const doubleUserAge = user => ({...user, age: user.age * 2})

const incrementUserAge = user => ({...user, age: user.age + 1})
```

This guarantees the same results, irrespective of the call order;

```
doubleUserAge(user) // 62

incrementUserAge(user) // 32

incrementUserAge() // 32

doubleUserAge()
```

The above demonstrates how to work with references types, without modifying the original.
