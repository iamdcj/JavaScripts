# Inheritance in JS

### What is it?
Inheritance a mechanism which allows one object to successfully reference/utilise properties/methods from another object.

### How it works?
Inheritance is achieved by utilising prototype objects;

> Objects have an internal `prototype` property which points an object; a prototype object. These prototype objects act as templates which other objects can inherit properties and methods from.


#### 'Constructor' functions
A key component of making inheritance work in JavaScript are what are referred to as 'Constructor' functions**; functions which construct a thing(object).



The following is an example of a constructor function:
```
function Player(name, position) {
  this.name = name;
  this.position = position;
}
```

Which we use to generate a new 'Player' instance:
```
const Xavi = new Player("Xavi Hernandez, "CM");
```

We can use the `Player()` constructor to generate as many instances we desire, each one inheriting properties and methods from the original.

#### Adding additional things
If we want to add additional things to the constructor function, which will then be inherited by any instances created by the constructor, we must add them to the constructors prototype; the prototype is used for inheritance in JavaScript.

```
Player.prototype.bio = function() { 
  console.log(`My name is ${this.name}, and I play ${this.position}`)
}
```

All instances of Player can now reference the `bio` property via the prototype of Player.

```
Xavi.bio()
// My name is Xavi Hernandez, and I play CM
```

And, thanks to the prototype chain our instances can also access the built-in Object's methods and properties;

```
Xavi.valueOf() // valueOf is a method on Object, the end of the chain so to speak.

// PlayerÂ {name: "Xavi Hernandez", position: "CM"}
```

We can see from the above that inheritance across multiple instances of a thing is possible because of 'prototypal inheritance'.

NOTES
** All functions preceded by `new` will indeed get a `constructor` property; this `constructor` property is a reference to the original function.
