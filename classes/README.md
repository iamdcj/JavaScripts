# Classes

## What is a Class?
A class represents a particular type of thing, e.g. a car, a user, a job.

* Classes utilise the prototypal inheritance mechanism.
* Classes act as blueprints for one of these things.
* Classes contain fields and methods which can be referenced throughout a program's lifecycle.

## What does/can a class do?
Classes can do the following things:

- Inherit properties from parent/super classes.
- Mark fields and methods as private, protected or by default public, thus providing different levels of priviledge.
- Retrieve and set properties using get and set methods
- Static methods can be added, and called on the class itself, not instances of.

## Notes
The following all apply to JS classes;

* They are not hoisted; you must declare a class before you can reference it.
* The code within a class is strictly strict mode.
