# Classes

## What is a Class?

A class represents a particular type of thing, e.g. a car, a user, a job.

Classes act as blueprints for one of these things.

Classes contain fields and methods which can be referenced throughout a program's lifecycle.

## What can a class do?

Classes can do the following things:

- Inherit properties from parent/super classes.
- Mark fields and methods as private, protected or by default public, thus providing different levels of priviledge.
