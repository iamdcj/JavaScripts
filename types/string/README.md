# Strings

### `typeof` string

Strings are a series of characters contained within single or double quotations; they usually represent lines of text.

Examples:

```
"I am David"
'HOLA MUNDIAL'
`String bean`
```

It is often thought that strings in JS are simply arrays of characters, but strings are immutable and cannot be modified in place, whereas arrays are mutable. 

If you want to treat a string as an array, there are many methods and approaches you can utilises in order to do so.
