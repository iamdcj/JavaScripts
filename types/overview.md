# Types in JavaScript

JavaScript, like all programming has a set a of datatypes that can be manipulated in order to build applications.

Types(some of the) are the building blocks of any program written in a language, without them we can't do jack.

It is argued that JS doesn't have types, due to its dynamic/loose nature, however the spec. uses the term "type".

There are a total of seven built-in JS types, and they fall into two categories of types; Primitive and Composite.

### Primitive Types
These types are the lowest-level types in the language;

#### number (typeof number)

There is not a distinction between integer and fractional numbers in JS; all numbers in JS are floating-point numbers.

An integer in JS is a number without a decimal value, so `19.0` and `19` aren't distinct types of number in the language.

See "IEEE 754" standard for more details;

#### string (typeof string)
#### boolean (typeof boolean)
#### null (typeof object)
#### undefined (typeof undefined)
#### symbol (typeof symbol)


### Composite Types

#### object 
The `object` type covers objects, functions and arrays. It might make sense for functions and arrays to be distinct types, but nope, they are all types of objects in the JS language.


##### Objects (typeof object)

##### Arrays (typeof object)
 
##### Functions (typeof function)
