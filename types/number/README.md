# Number

### `typeof` number

JS implements one type for `number` - there is not a distinction between integer and fractional numbers in JS; all numbers in JS are floating-point numbers.

An integer in JS is a number without a decimal value, so `19.0` and `19` are both just a `number` in JavaScript, opposed to `integer` and `decimal`.

Examples:

```
47
67.
87.1
9
-10
```

See [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) standard for more details on JS numbers.
