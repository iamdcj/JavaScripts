# Function Scope
Each function creates a new lexical environment, nesting functions results in nested lexical environments; lexical scope.

### Common
Function scope is the most common type of 'local scope' in JavaScript programs; functions are used a lot.

### Privacy
By wrapping code in a function we hide it from parent and sibling scopes.
