# Local Scope
Any bindings which do not live in the global environment are in a local scope; they are part of a local lexical environment.

## Types of Local Scope
JavaScript supports the following types of local scope;

**Function Scope** - any bindings wrapped by a function create a new lexical environment.

**Block** - a let or const statement wrapped inside a block will be bound to that block's lexical environment.
