# Function Scope

### What is it?
Function scope is code which is tied to the lexical environment for that function.

Function scope is the most common type of 'local scope' in JavaScript programs; functions are used a lot.

### How does it work?
Each function creates a new lexical environment, the nesting of functions results in nested lexical environments; this is what is known as lexical scoping.
