# Lexical Environment 

### What is a Lexical Environment?
---
A lexical environment is a place in a program where code lives, i.e. it is a section of the source where functions and variables are declared. I personally consider lexical environment interchangable with scope ~ a place in the program where bindings live.

> A Lexical Environment is a specification type used to define the association of Identifiers to specific variables and functions based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code - [JS Spec.](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-lexical-environments)

Every program contains bindings, and these bindings belong to a specific lexical environment.


__*It is the nesting of these environments which determine the lexical scope of a program.*__
 
### How are Lexical Environments generated?
---
Each time we create a new function, block or module a lexical environment will be generated when the source code is compiled/interpreted.

>  Usually a Lexical Environment is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a FunctionDeclaration, a BlockStatement, or a Catch clause of a TryStatement and a new Lexical Environment is created each time such code is evaluated - [JS Spec.](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-lexical-environments)

The Global Environment is generated for each program.

#### What is in a Lexical Environment?
---
A lexical environemnt consists of the following:

__Environment Record__ - a record of all the variable and function declarations within the scope of that environment.

__Outer Reference__ - a reference to the surrounding lexical environment.

> A Lexical Environment consists of an Environment Record and a possibly null reference to an outer Lexical Environment. - [JS Spec.](https://tc39.es/ecma262/)


### Types of Lexical Environments
---
The following are the different types of Lexical Environments that can be generated in a JS application;

#### Global Environment (Global Scope)
A lexical environment without an outer lexical environment is the global environment;

> global environment is a Lexical Environment which does not have an outer environment. - [JS Spec.](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-lexical-environments)


#### Function Environment (Function Scope)
Each time a function is invoked, a new lexical environment is created for that respective function.

> A function environment is a Lexical Environment that corresponds to the invocation of an ECMAScript function object. A function environment may establish a new this binding. A function environment also captures the state necessary to support super method invocations. - [JS Spec.](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-lexical-environments)



#### Module Environment (Module Scope)
Each time a module is created in the source code, a new lexical environment is created for that respective module.

>A module environment is a Lexical Environment that contains the bindings for the top level declarations of a Module. It also contains the bindings that are explicitly imported by the Module. The outer environment of a module environment is a global environment. - [JS Spec.](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-lexical-environments)
