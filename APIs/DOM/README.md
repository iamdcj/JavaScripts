# The DOM

The Document Object Model is an object representation of a HTML document, generated when loaded into a browser. It represents both the elements and content in a document, these are refered to as *nodes*.

## Working with the DOM 
The DOM provides a way for JavaScript(and other languages) to interact with, and manipulate web documents. Pretty much all client-side JavaScript is authored with the end goal of updating the DOM in some way or another.
