# XMLHttpRequest

The `XMLHttpRequest` is an object baked into the browser, which allows engineers to make `HTTP` requests in JavaScript applications, i.e. it is used to communicate with servers.

The `XHR` object is synonymous with the **A\***synchronous\* **J\***avaScript\* **A\***nd\* **X\***ML\* approach to JavaScript programming.

There is an alternate, more modern API available when make HTTP requests; the [`Fetch`](../Fetch) API.
