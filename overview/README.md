# JavaScript; an overview

The JavaScript is a fully-fledged programming language(ignore the haters), and possesses the following properties and features;

### **Lightweight**

JavaScript is a fairly simple programming language without proper types, making it lightweight and portable.

### **High-Level**

JavaScript is highly abstracted from the machine code/instructions, making it a very programmer/human-friendly language to engineer.

### **Interpreted/JIT-compiled**

JavaScript is classicaly perceived to be an interpreted language, however newer engines such as Chrome's V8, perform just-in-time compilation.

### **Cross-platform**

JavaScript has classically been used as a client-side language, exclusively in web browsers, however over the years JavaScript has crossed platforms and started to be used for back-end development.

### **Multi-paradigm**

You can use functional, imperativel, event-driven and object-oriented paradigms when developing JavaScript programs.

#### Object-oriented Programming

JavaScript is a prototype-based language, and inheritance is achieved via prototype objects.

#### Functional

#### Imperative

#### Event Driven

### **Dynamic**

JavaScript doesn't have static/stric typing, i.e. variables do not need to be assigned at type when being declared; _**the values have types, not the variable itself.**_
