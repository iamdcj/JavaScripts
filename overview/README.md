# JavaScript; an overview

The JavaScript is a fully-fledged programming language(ignore the haters), and possesses the following properties and features;

### **Lightweight**

JavaScript is a fairly simple programming language, without proper types, making it lightweight and portable.

### **High-Level**

Something about abstraction from the machine.

### **Interpreted/JIT-compiled**

Sigh.

### **Cross-platform**

JavaScript has classically been used as a client-side language, exclusively in web browsers, however over the years JavaScript has crossed platforms and started to be used for back-end development.

### **Multi-paradigm**

You can code functionality, imperatively and object-oriented when developing JavaScript programs.

#### Object-oriented Programming via Prototypes

JavaScript is a prototype-based language, and inheritance is achieved via prototype objects.

### **Dynamic**

JavaScript doesn't have static/stric typing, i.e. variables do not need to be assigned at type when being declared; _**the values have types, not the variable itself.**_
