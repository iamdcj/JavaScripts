# Overview

The JavaScript language is a fully-fledged programming language, despite what some might say, and it possesses the following properties and features;

### **Lightweight**

JavaScript is a fairly simple programming language without proper types, making it lightweight and portable.

### **High-Level**

JavaScript is highly abstracted from the machine code/instructions, making it a very programmer-friendly language to work with when engineering applications.

### **Interpreted/JIT-compiled**

JavaScript is classicaly perceived to be an interpreted language, however newer engines such as Chrome's V8 perform Just-In-Time compilation; the code is not compiled ahead of time into a bytecode, instead it is compiled on-the-fly as the code is being executed.

### **Cross-Platform**

JavaScript has classically been used as a client-side language, a pretty much exclusively in web browsers, however over the years JavaScript has crossed platforms and started to be used for back-end development, thanks mainly to the advent of the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime.

### **Dynamic / Loose**

JavaScript doesn't have static/strict typing, i.e. variables do not need to be assigned a type when being declared; **_in JavaScript the values have types, not the variable itself._**

### **Multi-paradigm**

You can use functional, imperative, event-driven and object-oriented paradigms when engineering JavaScript applications;

#### Object-oriented Programming

JavaScript is a prototype-based language, and inheritance is achieved via `prototype` objects.
