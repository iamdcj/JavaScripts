# JavaScript; an overview

The JavaScript is a fully-fledged programming language(ignore the haters), and possesses the following properties and features;

#### **_Lightweight_**

JavaScript is a fairly simple programming language, without proper types, making it lightweight and portable.

#### **_High-Level_**

Something about abstraction from the machine.

#### **_Interpreted/JIT-compiled_**

Sigh.

#### **_Cross-platform_**

JavaScript has classically been used as a client-side language, exclusively in web browsers, however over the years JavaScript has crossed platforms and started to be used for back-end development.

#### **_Multi-paradigm_**

You can code functionality, imperatively and object-oriented when developing JavaScript programs.

#### **_Dynamic_**

JavaScript doesn't have static/stric typing, i.e. variables do not need to be assigned at type when being declared; _**the values have types, not the variable itself.**_
