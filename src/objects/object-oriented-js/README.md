# Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript

Object-Oriented Programming is an approach to engineering which utilises objects in a language to 'model' things in our applications that exist in the real world, e.g. a `user`

```
const user = {
  name: "David Jones"
  id: 12345,
  age: 32,
  bio: "A string"
}

```

Objects usually encapsulate related pieces of data and methods, which is a big convenience for programmers as it this organisatiion allows us to easily access related data and functionality via the object namespace.
