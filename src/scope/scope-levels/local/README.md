# Local Scope

### What is it?

Any bindings which do not live in the global environment are in a local scope; they are part of a local lexical environment.

### How to use it?

Block scoping can be achieved using let and const statements.

### Why use it?

Block scoping allows for code to be scoped to a certain part of the program, much like function scope.
