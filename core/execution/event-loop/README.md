# Event Loop

The event loop is concurrent tracking model used to manage the execution JavaScript applications.

It's primary purpose is to monitor the [**call stack**](call-stack) in a JS application via a certain runtime, e.g. the V8 browser runtime, and the **task queue** generated by any APIs which handle asynchronous tasks.

### How it all works

- **Call Stack** tracks where we are in an application relative to the functions we call.
- **Task Queue** handles any asynchronous operations we declare in our code to prevent functions from blocking the call stack.
- **Event Loop** tracks what is happening with both the stack and the queue, and will only add queued operations to the stack once the stack is clear.
