# Call Stack

The call stack, a.k.a the execution stack, is a data structure with the purpose of **tracking where in a program we are**, that is what is currerntly executing at that time(see [execution contexts](./../execution-context)).

JavaScript is a single-threaded runtime, i.e. it has one **call stack**, permitting it to do _one thing at a time_.

### How it works

For each execution context we enter during the execution phase, we add an item to the stack, starting with the global execution context.

We have yet to call any functions, but the global execution context fires automatically when the program downloads, putting it first on the stack;

```
GLOBAL()
```

Then for every function we invoke, a new item is added to the stack;

```
function c() {
  return 'HELLO WORLD';
}

function b() {
  return c();
}

function a() {
  const message = b();
  console.log(message)
}

a()

// HELLO WORLD
```

So, lets update our stack based on the program above ðŸ‘†

First we call `a`

```
GLOBAL()
a()
```

which then calls `b`

```
GLOBAL()
a()
b()
```

and `b` calls `c`

```
GLOBAL()
a()
b()
c()
```

Now, every time we call a function we add it to the stack, but every time we `return`(or reach the end) from a function we remove it from the stack;

`c` returns a string

```
GLOBAL()
a()
b()
```

`b` returns a call to `c`,

```
GLOBAL()
a()
```

`a` doesn't return, but completes after the log statement.

```
GLOBAL()
```

The program has no more functions to deal with, and it is done.

```
[ EMPTY ]
```

#### Stack Tracing

A stack trace is something which becomes apparent, and useful, when an error is thrown in a application; it is this stack trace which gives some insight to the call stack data structure, for example;

```
function c() {
  throw new Error('here')
}

function b() {
  return c();
}

function a() {
  const message = b();
  console.log(message)
}

a()

```

The browser `log` will print the following:

```
Uncaught Error: here // exception
  at c (<anonymous>:2:9)  // enter c
  at b (<anonymous>:6:10) // enter b
  at a (<anonymous>:10:19) // enter a
  at <anonymous>:14:1 // Initial global call
```

The above is a stack trace, showing what was called, and place in the stack things went wrong.

#### Blocking the Stack

The [task queue](../task-queue) defers any asynchronous callbacks to prevent the call stack from being blocked by potentially slow code, however if some synchronous task is slow or overly repetitive, then the call stack will jam-up until the slow code has done its thing - the big problem with this is that **it blocks user interactions**

Let's say we a call to action in our markup;

```
<button>Click Me</button>
```

and we have a badly written, slow piece of running code in our javaScript application;

```
  let i = 0
  while (i < 1000000000) {
    i++
  }
  console.log(i);
```

the user will be unable to click the button until the `while` loop is complete.
