# Identifiers

Identifiers are a series of characters which point to a chunk of code in an application.

Identifiers are used to reference bindings, for example:

- **Variables**: a chunk of code stored in a variable.
- **Function**: reusable chunks of code which perform a specific task
  - parameters/arguments.
- **Properties**: object keys.

Using identifiers in our code allows for easy code reuse; pieces of code can be accessed multiple times in various places.

## Rules of Validation

The JavaScript engine enforces rules to prevent engineers using invalid character series when declaring identifiers - these rules differ for variables/function and properties;

- [Variables/Functions](variables)
- [Properties](properties)
