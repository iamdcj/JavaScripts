# Lexical Structure

The lexical structure of a language defines the base rules and configuration required to correctly author code in a particular language.

It defines the following aspect of how a language is written:

- [Character Set](character-set) - what character set the language uses
- [Reserved Words](reserved-words) - keywords which are part of the language's core, and cannot be used as identifiers.
- [Identifiers](Identifiers) - the rules which define how we create our variables/function labels.
- [Case Sensitivity](case-sensitivity) - how different cases are handled in the language.
- [Semicolons](semicolons) - where and when semicolons are required.
- [Comments](comments) - the various supported commenting syntax.
- [White Space](white-space) - how the language deals with whitespace and line-breaks.

It is imperative to have a full understanding of the above to ensure programs are written in accordance with the lexical grammar of the ECMAScript specification.
