# Lexical Structure

The lexical structure of a language defines the base rules and configuration required to correctly author code in a particular language.

It defines the following aspect of how a language is written:

- [Character Set](character-set) - what character set is the language uses
- [Reserved Words](reserved-words) - keywords which are used in the core language, and cannot be used as identifiers.
- [identifiers](Identifiers) - how we declare our variables/function labels.
- [Case Sensitivity](case-sensitivity) - how different cases are handled.
- [Semicolons](semicolons) - where and when semicolons are required.
- [Comments](comments) - the various supported comment syntax
- [White Space](white-space) - how a language deals with whitespace and line-breaks.

It is imperative to have a full understanding of the above to ensure the programs are written in accordance with the lexical grammar of the JavaScript language.
