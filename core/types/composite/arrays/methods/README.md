# Array Method

The following list of methods are extremely useful when working with arrays in JavaScript applications;

- [forEach](./forEach) - a generic iterator which provides the item for each iteration, but does not return a value; a cleaner for loop.
- [includes](./includes) - checks for the presence of an item in array, returning a `boolean`.
