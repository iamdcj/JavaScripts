# Promise Methods

Promises allow you to handle the result of a `Promise` instance once it has resolved, and it also provides methods for dealing with a collection promises.

These methods provide the engineer with extremely useful ways of handling control flow when dealing with asynchronous operations.

## Executor Methods

These methods are built-in methods which allow the engineer to explicitly handle the [state](../states) of a promise instance.

## [Static Methods](./static)

These methods provide a way for engineers to handle a `Promise` instance, or a collection of `Promise` instances.

## [Instance Methods](./instance)

These methods deal with the outcome of the Promises, whether that be a solitary promise, or a collection of promises.
