# if...else

The `if` statement provides a control structure which will execute a particular statement/set of statements based on the given conditions.

## `if` with `else`

`if` the condition is truthy, then run the following statement/set of statements,
`else` run the statement/set of statements following the `else` statement.

The following snippet will result in `false` being returned

```
if(1 > 2) {
  return true;
} else {
  return false;
}
```

The given condition will resolve as `false`, and the execution will fall in to the `else` clause.

## `if` without `else`

## `if`...`else if`...`else`

## Mutiple statements within a clause
