# Control Flow Statements

The following statements deal with control flow in JS applications; _control flow handles the order in which statements are executed in program_

If a program doesn't contain any control flow structures, then it would simply run form the first line, to the last - this sort of program wouldn't be particularly complex, and likely pretty useless due to absence of logic.

The following are all the control flow statements in JS:

- block ({})
- [if...else](./if-else/)
- switch
- break
- throw
- try...catch
- continue
- empty
