# Control Flow Statements

The following statements dealing with control flow in an application; _control flow handles the order in which statements are executed in an application_

If a program doesn't contain any control flow structures then it would simply run form the first line, to the last, however this sort of program wouldn't be particularly complex, and likely pretty useless.

The following are the control flow statements in the JavaScript language:

- block ({})
- [if...else](./if-else/)
- switch
- break
- throw
- try...catch
- continue
- empty
