# Control Flow Statements

The following statements deal with control flow in JS applications; _control flow handles the order in which statements are executed in program_

**Control flow determines the execution path of a program.**

If a program doesn't contain any control flow structures, then it would simply run form the first line, to the last - this sort of program wouldn't be particularly complex, and likely pretty useless due to absence of logic.

The following are all the control flow statements in JS:

**Generic**
- block 
- empty

**Conditionals**
- [if...else](./if-else/) 
- switch 

**Error**
- throw 
- try...catch

**Terminators**
- break 
- continue
