# Statements

Statements in a program are instructions, informing the executing engine what a piece of code is, and what it is to do.

A program written in JavaScript, as per any other language, consists of numerous statements; **_the bigger the application, the more statements(instructions) it will contain._**

```
const variableStatement = "hold a string, this string, any string";
```

JavaScript statements fall into the following categories;

- [Control flow](./control-flow)
- Declarations
- Functions and Classes
- Iterators
- Other
