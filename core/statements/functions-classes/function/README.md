### Functions

A function declaration consists of the `function` keyword, followed by an identifier, the function body block(`{}`) which contains the statements which make-up the function body.

```
function aFunction() {
  console.log('test');
}
```

Function declarations are in more detail [here](../functions-classes/function).
