# Declarations in JavaScript

A declaration is a statement which determines a binding; a variable or function, using a language keyword, an identitifier, and a value.

### Variables

The following are the supported variable declarations within the JavaScript language;

`const`
`let`
`var`

Variable declarations are covered in more detail [here](../../../core/variables).

### Functions

A function declaration consists of the `function` keyword, followed by an identifier, the function body block(`{}`) which contains the statements which make-up the function body.

```
function aFunction() {
  console.log('test');
}
```

Function declarations are in more detail [here](../functions-classes/function).
