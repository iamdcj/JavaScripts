# Scope

Usually when talking about scope, we are referring to how we lookup and retrieve code in our applications.

**_Scope is the set of rules which govern where bindings are stored and retrieved._**

##### Scope is code accessibility

It defines what bindings are accessible within the current [execution context](../execution/execution-context/), i.e. what bindings can be successfully retrieved inside `function` X when it is invoked.

#### Defining the Scope(s)

The scopes of a program are determined by the author; the code they create informs the engine of the program's intended scopes - these scopes are then cemented during the compilation/interpretation phase of the programâ€™s lifecycle; [scope generation](01-generation).

Scope defined by the authored source code structure is known as [lexical scope](./lexical-scope).

Once the scopes have been generated using the scoping rules, we can then executed our scoped code; [execution of scoped code](02-execution).

#### Scope levels

JavaScript possesses two levels of scope, and depending on where and how we declare them, our bindings will belong to either one of these scopes:

- [**Global Scope**](scope-levels/global) - code which can be accessed at all points of a program, i.e. lives in the global .

- [**Local Scope**](scope-levels/local) - code which is stored inside of one of the following creates its own local [lexical environment](./lexical-environment), and is not part of the global [lexical environment](./lexical-environment);
  - [Function](scope-levels/local/function)
  - [Block](scope-levels/local/block)
