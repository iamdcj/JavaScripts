# Local Scope

Any bindings which do not live in the global lexical environment are part of a local lexical environment.

There are two distinct types of local scope; **function scope**, and **block scope**.

- **[Function Scope](function)** - any code that is wrapped in a function is part of that functionâ€™s scope.

- **[Block Scope](block)** - `const` and `let` declarations create block scopes when declared inside a `{}` block.
