# Variables

Variables are containers for values, i.e. they hold pieces of code which can be reused whevener needed during the lifecycle of an application.

## Declarations

There a three ways to declare variables in Javascript:

### [`const`](/const)

`const` declarations are variables which cannot be reassigned a new value later in the application's lifecycle, thus must be initialized upon creation.

### [`let`](/let)

`let` declarations are variables which can be reassigned a new value later in the application.

### `var`

`var` declarations are variables which can be reassigned a new value later in the application.
