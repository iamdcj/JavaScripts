# Var

The `var` statement is used to declare bindings in a program.

## **Reassignment and Redeclaration**

### **Reassignment**

Any variable declared using the `var` keyword can be reassigned, i.e. its value/type can be changed from the originally initalised value or type.

```
var foo = "bar"

foo = 1987;

foo = false;
```

### Redeclaration

Variables declared with `var` can be declared multiple times in the same scope.
